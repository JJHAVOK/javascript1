# First Js Steps üë£

A test website and my very first dedicated project using **JavaScript**. This project serves as a crucial sandbox to practice core JavaScript concepts, master basic DOM manipulation, and build foundational web development skills.

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to:

* **Complete a full-stack front-end project** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Successfully build a functional and interactive feature from start to finish.
* Demonstrate a clear understanding of how the three core web technologies work together.

## ‚ú® Key Features

This project is primarily focused on execution and implementation. The current key feature is to **Learn** by successfully implementing the following:

* **HTML Structure:** Establishing a well-formed, semantic document outline.
* **CSS Styling:** Applying modern layout techniques (like Flexbox or Grid) and responsive design.
* **JavaScript Interactivity:** Writing functions that respond to user actions (clicks, inputs, etc.) and dynamically update the content of the page.
